        <h2 class="sub">About</h2>
        <p class="para">Lego is a toy company that makes bricks that can attach themselves to each other making unique designs. The name 'LEGO' is an abbreviation of the two Danish words “leg godt”, meaning “play well”. The LEGO Group was founded in 1932 by Ole Kirk
            Kristiansen. The company has passed from father to son and is now owned by Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, a grandchild of the founder. Over time, Lego has been one of the most played toys in the world as they are easy to play with and are very fun.
            Lego is cheap and very durable. These toys can be reused over and over again without breaking. As it grew larger, Lego have made new products like Wedo and Mindstorm.</p>
